            <p>
                I moved out to Boulder, Colorado from Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 2015 because I wanted to live
                in the mountains. I took a job in a restaraunt to make ends meet while I spent as much time as I
                could climbing. So, for the past six years I've been bartending and managing at the Dark Horse in 
                Boulder.

                Over the past year, with the pandemic, and the subsequent shutdowns and restrictions on the service
                industry, I realized that it was time for me to move on. I thought of learning how to code because
                of friends in the industry. They encouraged me to pursue coding, so, here I am in the DU coding bootcamp.
                My favorite part of learning web development has been the problem solving aspect. There is nothing
                more satisfying than figuring out a problem.
